# art_classification

The work in this project is aimed at building the best predictive model in the context of a classification problem: specifically, multiple deep learning architectures using convolutional neural networks (CNN) are tested with the aim of classifying images of objects commonly found in museums, divided into 5 categories: *drawings, engravings, iconographies, paintings, and sculptures.*
