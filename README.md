# art_classification

The work in this project is aimed at building the best predictive model in the context of a classification problem: specifically, multiple deep learning architectures using convolutional neural networks (CNN) are tested with the aim of classifying images of objects commonly found in museums, divided into 5 categories: *drawings, engravings, iconographies, paintings, and sculptures.*

The dataset used in this work is a collection of five different types of artworks (drawings, engravings, iconographies, paintings, and sculptures) downloaded from google images, yandex images and [this site](https://rusmuseumvrm.ru/collections/index.php?lang=en).
The dataset is downloadable from Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/thedownhill/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving)

The main folder contains 5 sub-folders, one for each class, and each class contains a different number of images of different sizes.
The total number of images is 8685, 108 of which were corrupted files that could not be read, and consequently were discarded; the cleaned version of the dataset can be downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CAfhTejZeS2moWcM7CtxtvthnODQDXXu)
